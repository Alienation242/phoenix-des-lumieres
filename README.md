# Phoenix des Lumières — SW wall

Content for one surface of a twelve-surface projection mapping inside a
62 × 38 m exhibition hall. This repo holds the **SW wall**: the 2:40–4:00 slice
of a ten-minute, 30 fps loop, delivered as two video plates.

Everything here was derived by measuring the supplied files rather than assuming.

---

## ⚠ A fresh clone cannot render yet

The two noise plates are **gitignored** — 0.80 GB and 0.79 GB, far over GitHub's
100 MB file limit. The clone has the mask, the venue reference and everything
generated from them, but not the video.

```
RawNoise/
  3d room mask.png                     ✓ in the clone
  PxDL_SW_9788x2552 (0-00-00-00).png   ✓ in the clone
  PxDL_SW_SPSW1.mp4                    ✗ copy it in  (0.80 GB)
  PxDL_SW_SPSW2.mp4                    ✗ copy it in  (0.79 GB)
```

Either copy the two mp4s into `RawNoise/`, or point
`_pipeline/project.json` → `source_hq` at the ProRes masters and pass `--hq`,
in which case you never need the mp4s on that machine at all.

`work/`, `render/` and `deliver/` are gitignored too — they are regenerated
output and never travel.

## Setup on a new machine

```powershell
python -m pip install moderngl

cd _pipeline\scripts
.\get_ffmpeg.ps1                     # a full ffmpeg into _pipeline\bin (~106 MB)
.\check_environment.ps1              # VRAM, disk, ffmpeg, source files

# point the big folders at fast storage
$env:PXDL_WORK_ROOT    = "E:\PxDL\work"
$env:PXDL_RENDER_ROOT  = "E:\PxDL\render"
$env:PXDL_DELIVER_ROOT = "E:\PxDL\deliver"

# 30 seconds at quarter size, straight to a small MP4
python render_shader.py --div 4 --start 5700 --count 900 --mp4 --preview-width 1224
```

You also need a **full ffmpeg build**, and there is a script for it:

```powershell
.\get_ffmpeg.ps1
```

It fetches the official Windows build, verifies it against the publisher's
SHA-256 and drops it in `_pipeline\bin\`, which every script checks before
`PATH`. Nothing is installed and no admin rights are needed. The binary is
~100 MB so it is gitignored — **run this on every machine you clone to.**

Without it there is no ProRes and no H.264 encoder: every delivery preset stops
at preflight, and previews fall back to mpeg4 — the full 80-second preview came
out at 49 MB that way, where x264 at the same size would be a small fraction of
it.

**If the machine has no working internet** (`getaddrinfo failed`,
`Could not resolve host` — broken DNS, which happened twice on this job), do
this on a machine that does:

```powershell
.\make_offline_bundle.ps1
```

then copy the `_offline_bundle` folder it makes across and double-click
`INSTALL.cmd` inside it. It carries the python wheels and ffmpeg, installs both
without touching the network, and tells you what is still missing. See
`docs/02_PORTABLE_RENDER.md`.

Nothing in the pipeline needs a licensed application.

## Tuning the look

**Double-click `TUNE.cmd`.** A page opens in your browser with sliders for
colour, contrast, the noise plate, the oil and the dither. Move one and the wall
re-renders — a real frame through `render_shader.py`, so what you see is what
the delivery makes. The first frame of a session takes a few seconds — the
renderer starts, and the noise plate has to be seeked into once — and after
that it stays up and frames land in about a fifth of a second. The plate is
read ahead of the playhead in the background, so scrubbing forward and the
bookmark buttons cost nothing once they have warmed up.

The line next to **Render now** says where the time went: `plate` is the noise
plate (0 when it was read ahead, most of a second when it had to seek),
`draw` is the wall itself — single-figure milliseconds — and `png` is getting
the picture into the browser. If a render feels slow, that line says which of
the three to blame.

- **Save** writes `_pipeline/look.json`. `render_shader.py` loads that as its
  *defaults*, so **`EXPORT.cmd` renders your look** with nothing else to
  remember. It prints `look  N setting(s) from …` when it does.
- Command-line flags still beat the file, and `--no-look` ignores it.
- **◆ keyframes a setting.** Once it has one key it turns amber, and its
  slider then writes a key wherever the playhead is — move the frame, move the
  slider, that is a second key. A small graph under the row draws the curve
  across the whole segment. Between keys you get `hold`, `linear`, `smooth`,
  `ease-in` or `ease-out`, per track or per key, so one transition can snap
  while the next one glides. The look can move over the eighty seconds instead
  of being one setting for all of it.
- **1:1 detail** shows an unscaled slice. Fitting 2447 px into a browser hides
  exactly the dither and banding these sliders exist to judge.
- **Play ▶** renders a few seconds forward from the frame you are on and plays
  them in the page, at around 30 frames a second. Some of this look only exists
  in motion — the ripples grow, the sun crosses, the normals breathe — and a
  still cannot show you any of it. *Back to the frame* returns to the sliders.
- The bookmark buttons jump to the moments that matter — near-black at 2:40,
  strobing at 3:51. A look that only works at one of them is not finished.

`look.json` is small and **belongs in git**: it is the artistic decision, and it
is what makes another machine render the same wall.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| canvas geometry | **solved and verified** — see the five facts below |
| masks | **done** — 31 mattes, annotation text removed, rebuildable |
| reference data | **done** — arc, openings, region rectangles, ID map, SDF |
| background look | **working** — sky + clouds on the wall, thin-film oil in the windows |
| objects | **working, thin** — cubes, pyramids, diamonds, spheres travelling window → door. The choreography is the least developed part. |
| delivery chain | **built and tested** — slice, encode, verify, preview |
| full-resolution pass | **not yet run** |
| projection test on the actual wall | **not yet done** — the one step nobody should skip |

Measured throughput: **31 fps at 2447 × 638** (faster than realtime), and a full
9788 × 2552 background frame costs about **0.14 s** even on an Intel iGPU. The
GPU is not the bottleneck; decoding the noise and writing frames is.

---

## The five facts that matter

**1. The two videos overlap by 1000 px.** They are not two halves.
`SPSW1 = x 0..7200`, `SPSW2 = x 6200..9788`, canvas `9788 × 2552` = the mask
exactly. Verified by 2D cross-correlation.

**2. The overlap is not pre-blended.** Both plates carry full brightness there;
the soft edge is applied downstream. Render one master and slice it —
`make_delivery.ps1` does it in one pass — and never bake a ramp in.

**3. The noise plate is the floor, never the ceiling.** It runs across all twelve
surfaces and is what makes them read as one piece. Composite over it, never
replace it, never out-brighten it, and drive your parameters from its arc.

**4. Only black in the mask is non-projection.** Every other colour is a
projection surface; the colours describe surface *type*. Multiply the comp by
`MASK_08_PROJECTABLE` as the last step.

**5. TouchDesigner is out of the delivery path.** Non-Commercial refuses to
output above 1280 × 1280. `scripts/render_shader.py` runs the same GLSL on a
plain OpenGL 3.3 context at any resolution instead.

## Everything generated is reproducible

Nothing in `masks/` or `reference/` is hand-made. If any of it is lost or looks
wrong, delete it and re-run:

```powershell
python build_masks.py     # all 31 masks, region tables, opening ID map, SDF
python analyse_arc.py     # noise_arc.csv
```

---

## Open with the producer

1. **The C4D toolkit** (`TOOLKIT_3D_PxDL_MAINEXPO_v4.c4d`) — for the real wall
   dimensions and UV layout. The 6 m estimate is too low: the doors are 28.8 % of
   the canvas height, which would make them 1.73 m tall. The canvas is probably
   nearer 10 m. See `docs/00_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` §6.
2. **Codec preference** — offer ProRes 4444 plus the 16-bit master on the drive.
3. **Handles** — 4770–7229 (±1 s) is the current default.
